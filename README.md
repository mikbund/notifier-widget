Notifier-widget(GUI) and Notifier(SERVER) are the server and gui frontend to monitor events.

Notifier Widget runs on any windows/linux desktop using java. It runs minimized and when an event is created it pops up to notify the user something is happening. It is an effective tool to secure daily operation in devops teams. Events may come from every where - only requirement is the event has to be able to send a POST to the webhook end point.

It is possible to control events like supress or autoclose after a period of time. Very usefull if an event is fired constantly due to outtage.
